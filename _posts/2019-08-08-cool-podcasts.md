Just finished up the Tim Ferriss interview with [Ed Zschau](https://tim.blog/2019/08/01/ed-zschau/) this morning. Fabulous insight on how a difference-maker thinks. This man played a major part in me being able to do what I love to do, and I never even knew it.

Also, listen to the interview with [Seth Godin](https://tim.blog/2016/02/10/seth-godin/). Stunning insight on how arguably the world's greatest marketer thinks. Actually, I've listened to this episode three times.
