Use Ruby's JSON module to run simple Cucumber scenarios to test a RESTful API, DevOps style!

__Step 1__. Create the directory we'll be working

```
$ mkdir cucumber-json
$ cd cucumber-json
```

__Step 2__. Generate the Ruby application

```
$ bundle init
Writing new Gemfile to /cucumber-json/Gemfile
```

__Step 3__. Set up dependencies for cucumber and rspec

```
$ vim Gemfile
```
Should look something like this

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

git_source(:github) {|repo_name| "https://github.com/#{repo_name}" }

gem 'cucumber'
gem 'rspec'
```

__Step 4__. Install dependencies

Depending on the versions being used, you should see something similar to this.
```
$ bundle install

Bundle complete! 2 Gemfile dependencies, 17 gems now installed.
Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
```
Our tree looks like this.
```
$ tree
.
├── Gemfile
└── Gemfile.lock
```

__Step 5__. Initialize Cucumber
```
$ cucumber --init
  create   features
  create   features/step_definitions
  create   features/support
  create   features/support/env.rb
```
Our tree is now...

```
$ tree
.
├── Gemfile
├── Gemfile.lock
└── features
    ├── step_definitions
    └── support
        └── env.rb

3 directories, 3 files
```

__Step 6__. Write a feature and scenario to test.
```
$ touch features/github.feature
$ vim vim features/github.feature
```
To keep it short, we can add a few expected JSON responses.
```feature
Feature: Test the Github API

Background:
  Given path "https://api.github.com"

Scenario: smoke test examples
  When a user requests "/"
  Then they are returned "current_user_url" => "https://api.github.com/user"
  Then they are returned "current_user_authorizations_html_url" => "https://github.com/settings/connections/applications{/client_id}"
  Then they are returned "authorizations_url" => "https://api.github.com/authorizations"
  Then they are returned "code_search_url" => "https://api.github.com/search/code?q={query}{&page,per_page,sort,order}"
  Then they are returned "commit_search_url" => "https://api.github.com/search/commits?q={query}{&page,per_page,sort,order}"
```

__Step 7__. Run the test (use this to cheat)
```
$ cucumber
```
The output should look something like this.

__Step 8__. Create step definitions with specs.
```
$ touch features/step_definitions/gitub_steps.rb
$ vim features/step_definitions/gitub_steps.rb
```

### We will use Ruby's built-in JSON module to parse curl requests. This is our secret weapon.
> Hint: copy/paste the empty test results into the step definitions file.

```ruby
require 'json'

Given("path {string}") do |string|
  @path = string
end

When("a user requests {string}") do |string|
  @hash = JSON.parse(`curl #{@path}#{string}`)
end

Then("they are returned {string} => {string}") do |key, value|
  expect(@hash[key]).to eq(value)
end
```

__Step 9__. Run the test.

```
$ cucumber
```

__Step 10__. Generate pretty output so the boss is happy.

```
$ cucumber -f pretty -f html -o report.html
```
This generates a nice HTML file for viewing.

The final tree

```
$ tree
.
├── Gemfile
├── Gemfile.lock
├── features
│   ├── github.feature
│   ├── step_definitions
│   │   └── gitub_steps.rb
│   └── support
│       └── env.rb
├── report
└── report.html

3 directories, 7 files
```

Of course there is a LOT more we can do with an API, this is just a quick "how to get started" demo. Hope you get some value from it.
