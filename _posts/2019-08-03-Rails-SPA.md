For my brother's nano-brewery, I wanted to build a simple, single-page application in which he could create, display, update, and delete content via a database. He also needed to be able easily upload images. I found a few tutorials on building a Rails-backend API with React-frontend, but at the time of this article, I didn't yet know much about React (or Angular for that matter) so we just went with Rails and Bootstrap.

For the content managememt I went with Active Admin, and Active Storage for images.
